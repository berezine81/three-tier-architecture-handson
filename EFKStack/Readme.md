# STEPS FOR DEPLOYING EFK STACK

INTRODUCTION

This project is all about getting hands-on with a sample microservices application called "Stan's Robot Shop," created by the awesome folks at IBM.

I am performing the following tasks in my project:

PART 1: DEPLOYING ON KUBERNETES EKS CLUSTER MANUALLY USING HELM CHARTS First part of the project will be to deploy this application on EKS Cluster.

PART 2 : SETUP OF MONITORING WITH PROMETHES & GRAFANA

PART 3: LOGGING WITH EFK (Elasticsearch, FluentD ,Kibana) STACK SETUP

PART 4: Build an automation CI pipeline to build & publish images to ECR repo.

PART 5: Deploy the microservices application using Argo CD.

To know more about the project visit: Github

The "Stan's Robot Shop" application serves as an exceptional platform to enhance your practical skills in deploying microservices on a Kubernetes Managed Cluster (EKS). This application utilizes various technologies, including NodeJS, Java (Spring Boot), Python (Flask), Golang, PHP (Apache), and more, creating a practical & realistic microservices environment.

This Blog specifically focuses on Part 3 of the project â€“ setting up the EFK Stack for logging within your EKS cluster. EFK stands for Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana, a powerful trio that forms a comprehensive log management solution.

Elasticsearch: A scalable and powerful search engine that serves as the foundation for storing and indexing your logs.

Fluentd: A log collector that gathers logs from various sources and forwards them to Elasticsearch for storage and analysis.

Kibana: A user-friendly web interface that allows you to visualize and analyze your logs, providing valuable insights into application behavior.

By deploying this EFK Stack on our EKS cluster, we'll build a centralized platform for managing and analyzing logs from our microservices application.

DEPLOYMENT STYLES

This project can be deployed in two ways, First way is directly applying the YAMLS .

Second way is going the GitOps way ! We can create an ArgoCD application that watches this repository & deploys it efficiently on our EKS cluster.

I have performed the deployment in both ways!

STEPS

Namespace setup: Namespace.yaml

We'll begin by creating a dedicated Namespace to isolate the EFK components from other applications running in the cluster. This ensures a well-organized and conflict-free deployment process.

spec:
  ports:
  - port: 9200
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: db
  selector:
    k8s-app: elasticsearch-logging

Elasticsearchsvc.yaml creates a service named elasticsearch-logging that acts as a gateway to access our Elasticsearch cluster within the logging namespace.

Elasticsearch StatefulSet Deployment (Elasticstatefulset.yaml)

Why StatefulSets for Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch, at its core, is a stateful application. It relies on persistent storage to maintain your log data.

StatefulSets provide the foundation for a robust and scalable Elasticsearch deployment within the EFK stack. This guarantees ordered pod startup, persistent storage for logs, and simplified management, allowing us to effectively collect, store, and analyze your application logs. They automate pod creation, ordering, and volume mounting, making managing your Elasticsearch cluster less complex.

        securityContext:
          privileged: true

Lets breakdown some of the main components of this yaml:

We are creating a ServiceAccount resource,Service accounts act as identities for pods, allowing them to request access to resources.

Clusterrole specifies the permissions pods with the elasticsearch-logging service account will have.

Clusterrolebinding binds the elasticsearch-logging cluster role to the elasticsearch-logging service account.

This effectively assigns the defined permissions (get access to services, namespaces, and endpoints) to pods using the elasticsearch-logging service account.

The label addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: Reconcile indicates that the Kubernetes resource (Service, ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, etc.) defined in the YAML file is managed by the Kubernetes addon-manager.

The initContainers section defines a container named elasticsearch-logging-init that runs with the alpine:3.6 image. This container serves ensures the necessary kernel parameter is configured before the main Elasticsearch container starts. This can be crucial for proper functioning of Elasticsearch within the Kubernetes environment.

Resources: Sets resource requests and limits for the container (CPU and memory).

Ports: Exposes ports 9200 (db) for database and 9300 (transport) for internal Elasticsearch communication.

Volume Mounts: Mounts a persistent volume claim named elasticsearch-logging to the /data directory within the container, providing persistent storage for log data.

Volumes: Defines a volume named elasticsearch-logging to be mounted by the pod.

Init Container : An init container is included to configure a kernel parameter (vm.max_map_count) required by Elasticsearch.

You might be wondering we have not defined any Persistent Volume Claim , then how is our volume being provisioned? If you have followed the project, The answer is that EBS CSI driver directly provisions volumes without explicit PVCs, simplifying volume management. It works for our use case.

PVCs offer dynamic provisioning, separation of concerns, volume reuse, snapshots, and advanced storage features.

Fluentd DaemonSets are essential for consistent log collection across Kubernetes nodes. They ensure that every node contributes to the centralized log pipeline.

Purpose of Fluentd DaemonSet:

Log Collection: Fluentd collects logs from various sources (files, standard output, etc.) across all nodes.

Centralized Forwarding: It forwards logs to a centralized destination (e.g., Elasticsearch, Logstash, or other logging systems).

Uniform Logging: Ensures consistent log collection and forwarding across the entire cluster.

This YAML file sets up Fluentd, a log collector, within a Kubernetes cluster:

Service Account: Defines a service account for Fluentd with necessary permissions.

Cluster Role: Specifies permissions for Fluentd to access Kubernetes resources.

Cluster Role Binding: Binds the service account to the cluster role.

DaemonSet: Deploys Fluentd pods across all nodes in the cluster.

Configures Fluentd container settings, including image, environment variables, and resources.

Mounts host paths and a ConfigMap for configuration files.

Defines a termination grace period for pod termination.

Access the service via the ingress URL

KIBANA IS ACCESSIBLE!

Click the Discover tab .

You may need to enter "*" in an index or the index you have defined in the configmap output block.

Voila! You can view the application logs of our microservices.

LOG ANALYSIS

I went to my application & created an Order, OrderID of which can be seen

Doing some tweaking with the filters, I can see the payload & other essential attributes of my request . This is a gamechanger when you face application issues!

I can also filter out on basis of namespace,containers etc, In this case I can figure out which microservice is throwing the most 500 errors !

Based on the error log count an SRE can create tickets for the developers to fix the issue.

SUMMARY

By deploying the EFK Stack, we created a centralized platform for managing and analyzing logs from our microservices application, enabling us to gain valuable insights into application behavior and troubleshoot issues effectively.

Additionally, we provided detailed YAML configurations and explanations for setting up Elasticsearch, Fluentd DaemonSet, Kibana deployment, and other components necessary for logging.
